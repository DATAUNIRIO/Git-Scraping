I just watched @simonw
 workshop on CODA (by @EscolaDeDados
 ) and it was awesome :D

He showed how to use GitHub Actions to do Web Scraping, and this technique is called Git Scraping.
This is the repo of the first exercise: https://github.com/beatrizmilz/usgs-scraper/blob/main/usgs.json

And we only had to change 1 file!
